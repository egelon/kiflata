A JAVA parser for my web site. Parses information for every product from another website, and adds this information to .csv files, ready for import into my store's database from phpmyadmin

Important note before you use it: You need to have Firefox installed in the default location (eg. C:\Program Files\Firefox)
The program will take command of a browser window via a library in order to have access to the generated DOM. This way it can even parse information that was generated via Javascript or Ajax calls.
